Early on you don't have deep attention from people.
They just scanning is there something fot them. 
With no commitment to anything. 
Just poking around because something is intriguing.
Maybe it was someones short, vague tweet.
Maybe search for something else but similar.
Maybe there actually is something that's worth their hustle.

They wont read big blocks of text.
Even short paragraphs wont get much focus.

Pictures will work, but it's easy to make them
vague, without precise message.
Headlines will get some good attention too, 
but you need good copy to make them work.

So you have their short attention span and few tools,
in form of visuals and short pieces of text.
