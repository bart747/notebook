# David Lynch on Catching Ideas

https://player.vimeo.com/video/182093266

- You can be surprised by what kind of places will let you catch ideas
- “There's no original ideas, it's just the ideas that you caught”
- “Happiness in the doing is so important ... It's our life going by”
- When you're in a creative flow ideas are easier to catch
- “Ideas can take you out of drudgery work”

By the way, just look at these amazing animations and color compositions.
